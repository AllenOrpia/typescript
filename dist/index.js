Typescript is a Javascript Superset
    * A language building up on JS
    * Adds new Features + Advantages to Javascript
    * Browser CAN'T execute it
    * Typescript is compiled to Javascript

? Why typescript
    * Allows us to catch errors during development
    * Helps us catch error before runtime

? Typescript Advantages
    * Adds types
    * Lets us avoid any unnecessary errors by using types
    * We can use modern IDE's which include these types
    * Adds NON-Javascript features like interfaces and generics
    * Meta-Programming Features like Decorators
    * Rich Configuration Options
    * Modern tooling that helps in non-typescript projects

? Core Types - Core primitive types in Typescript are all lowercase
    ! number - All numbers, no differentiation between integers or floats
    ! string - All text values
    ! boolean - true or false
    ! object - Any JS object, more specific types (type of object) are possible
    ! Array - Any JS array, type can be flexible or strict (regarding the element types)
    ! Tuple - Added by Typescript: Fixed-length and Fixed type array
    ! Enum - enum {NEW, OLD} - Added by typescript: Automatically enumerated global constant identifiers
    ! Any - Any kind of value, no specific type assignment, big disadvantage

! Typescript only helps us during developmen
    * That means. Typescript's type system only helps during development (i.e. before the code gets compiled)
    ! It does not change your runtime code

? Typescript types vs Javascript Types
    * Javascript is dynamically typed
    * Typescript is statically type, we defined the type during development, they don't suddenly change during runtime
    ! Key difference is: Javascript uses "dynamic types" (resolved at runtime), Typescript uses "static types" (set during development)

? Type Inference
    * Built in feature that typescript tries its best to understand which type we have in a certain variable or constant


? What's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
    * Work with (real-life) entities in your Code

? Classes and Instances
    ! Objects
        * The things you work with in code
        * Instances of classes (=based on classes)
        * Class-based creation is an alternative to using object literals
    ! Classes
        * Blueprints for objects (theoretical definition)
        * Define how objects look like, which properties and methods they have
        * Classes make creation of multiple, similar objects much easier
